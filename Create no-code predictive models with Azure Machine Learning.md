## Use automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning
### Intro
Azure Machine Learning is a cloud-based platform for building and operating machine learning solutions in Azure. It includes a wide range of features and capabilities that help data scientists prepare data, train models, publish predictive services, and monitor their usage. Most importantly, it helps data scientists increase their efficiency by automating many of the time-consuming tasks associated with training models; and it enables them to use cloud-based compute resources that scale effectively to handle large volumes of data while incurring costs only when actually used.

### Use cases
Machine learning tasks.

### How to
1. Create resource group
2. Create workspace
3. Go to ml.azure.com
4. Create compute instance
5. Create compute cluster
6. Create dataset
7. Run automated ML experiment or create notebook and run notebook. 
8. After the experiment has finished; you can review the best performing model that was generated.
9. You can deploy model as a service and test the deployed service.
