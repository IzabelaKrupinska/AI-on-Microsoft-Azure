## Azure Cognitive Speech Services

### Transcribe speech input to text
#### 1. Intro
The Speech-to-text aspect of the Speech services, in Azure Cognitive Services, provides real-time transcription of audio streams based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. The Speech services APIs allow developers to add end-to-end, real-time speech transcription to their applications or services.

#### 2. Use cases
Speech services can be use in scenarios like:
* translation of live presentations,
* in-person or remote translated communications,
* customer support,
* business intelligence,
* media subtitling,
* multilingual AI interactions.

#### 3. How to
To speech-to-text translation we need to create Azure Speech resource. To access our Speech Service from an application, we will need to get a subscription key that's passed with every request to authenticate the call and the endpoint that exposes our service on the network. We need to install Python and Visual Studio Code for coding.

Speech-translation services are designed to target specific language-translation scenarios. 

Speech Service is standard and free pricing: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/.


### Synthesize Text Input to Speech
#### 1. Intro
Text-to-speech is sometimes known as voice synthesizing. Typically a collection of synthesized voices are available for users to choose from. The text that is used for input, is evaluated and then passed to the synthesizer to generate the spoken words. Synthesized speech has improved over time and now sound less like a computer-generated representation. Speech synthesis is being adopted when:
* improving accessibility for example for people with visual impairment or reading difficulties,
* responding in multitasking scenarios to absorb important information quickly and comfortably ,
* enhancing learning with multiple modes,
* delivering intuitive bots or assistants.
