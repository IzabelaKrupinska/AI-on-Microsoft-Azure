## Azure Cognitive Speech Services

### Transcribe speech input to text
#### 1. Intro
The Speech-to-text aspect of the Speech services, in Azure Cognitive Services, provides real-time transcription of audio streams based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. The Speech services APIs allow developers to add end-to-end, real-time speech transcription to their applications or services.

#### 2. Use cases
Speech services can be use in scenarios like:
* translation of live presentations,
* in-person or remote translated communications,
* customer support,
* business intelligence,
* media subtitling,
* multilingual AI interactions.

#### 3. How to
To speech-to-text translation we need to create Azure Speech resource. To access your Speech Service from an application, we will need to get a subscription key that's passed with every request to authenticate the call and the endpoint that exposes our service on the network. We need to install Python and Visual Studio Code for coding.

Speech-translation services are designed to target specific language-translation scenarios.
